Project consisted of cleaning up the HTML Doc as well as consolidating the CSS style sheet as best as I could. 
Upon first glance there was an abundant amount of <div> elements everywhere and also improper semantic uses on teh header,footer and nav 
There was also a abundant amount of duplicate code in the css style sheet
Missing class tags which resulted in improper function of the navigation buttons.
